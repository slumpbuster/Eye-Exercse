# Eyes
<img src="./images/CookieMonster.png" height="200px" width="300px"/>

## Description 
This is a decent and easy representation of how one can use cascading style sheets and javascript to manipulate the display and functionality of a web page.  It also is a good representation of how a browser interacts with the movement of the mouse.
Originally, the example had one eye. A second eye was added as part of the original exercise. In doing so it reminded me of Cookie Monster from Sesame Street, so a mouth was added and a cookie for the cursor.
