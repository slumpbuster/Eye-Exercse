# Eyes
# <img src="./images/CookieMonster.jpg" height="200px" width="300px"/>

## Description 
This is a decent and easy representation of how one can use cascading style sheets and javascript to manipulate the display and functionality of a web page.  It also is a good representation of how a browser interacts with the movement of the mouse.
Originally, the example had one eye. A second eye was added as part of the original exercise. In doing so it reminded me of Cookie Monster from Sesame Street, so a mouth was added and a cookie for the cursor.

---------

## How to Run 
- Open the .html file in a browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
- Move the mouse around the browser and watch the eyes follow the cookie.

---------

## Files 
- **/images/CookieMonster.jpg** - Used in the Readme file 
- **/images/cookie.cur** - Cursor file used to change the default cursor 
- **index.html** - Start-up file to be opened by browse 
- **styles.css** - Stylesheet file that positions objects, controls text, colors, and layout
- **eyes.js** - Javascript file manipulating what is occuring in the browser 

---------

## Improvements Made
- 2022-02-04: Added a mouth
- 2022-02-04: Changed the mouse cursor to be a cookie

---------

## Roadmap of future improvements
- Add a tongue to the mouth when the cookie is over the mouth area

## Purpose 

This was done as an assignment in the MIT course - Full Stack Development with Mern
